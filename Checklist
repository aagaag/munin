This is a pre-release checklist for the maintainer.

 * is there any "FIX" in: ChangeLog, INSTALL, Announce?

 * Does make node-monkeywrench run without abnormal abortions?
 * Is .htaccess installed?
 * rm -f /etc/munin/plugins/* 
      Does munin-node-configure -d show any autoconf errors?

 * Update node/plugins.history.in:

   1.  cd plugins

   2. Figure out which r the previous tag was at and do this (r910 was
	  1.3.2 and r1234 is head)
      svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A | 
         cut -d/ -f 4- | sed 's/^node.d.//'

   3. Check if the listed plugins are still present (or moved):

      svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A |
          cut -d/ -f 4- | sed s'/(.*//' | xargs ls -ld >/dev/null

 * Update ChangeLog

 * cd ..; svn cp svn://janl@munin.projects.linpro.no/munin/trunk \
	svn://janl@munin.projects.linpro.no/munin/tags/1.3.4

 * Update RELEASE in the tag

 * make tar
