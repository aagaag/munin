# This file can be used as a .htaccess file, or a part of your apache
# config file.
#
# For the .htaccess file option to work the munin www directory
# (/var/cache/munin/www) must have "AllowOverride all" or something close
# to that set.
#
# As a config file enclose it in <directory> like so:
# 
# <directory /var/cache/munin/www>

# This next part requires mod_expires to be enabled.
#
# We could use <IfModule mod_expires> around here, but I want it to be
# as evident as possible that you either have to load mod_expires _or_
# you coment out/remove these lines.

# Set the default expiery time for files 5 minutes 10 seconds from
# their creation (modification) time.  There are probably new files by
# that time.
