For Debian packaging and init scripts, trunk/dists/debian is deprecated.

A branch for svn-buildpackage has been created at branches/debian,
with subdirectories for each release codename:

svn ls svn://munin.projects.linpro.no/munin/branches/debian

For munin SVN trunk, the easiest way is to checkout squeeze/trunk in the munin src dir as debian.  

$ svn co http://munin.projects.linpro.no/svn/munin/trunk/ munin-trunk
$ cd munin-trunk
$ svn co http://munin.projects.linpro.no/svn/munin/branches/debian/squeeze/trunk/debian/ debian

Now the usual dpkg-buildpackage should work flawlessly.
