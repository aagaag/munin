Introducing Munin 1.4.0!

The most important features:
* Better scalability through:
  - Multigraph plugins: One plugin, many graphs.
    This makes it possible to graph switches (and other things) efficiently
    In our test environment graphing one 16 port switch went from over 30
    seconds to 3 seconds (please see snmp__if_multi and multigraph_tester
    plugins for examples).
  - Prallelized munin-graph (tunable number of processes)
  - Nesting of groups to any depth: 
    "Conglomerate;US;New_York;Manhattan;6th-floor;" if you wish
  - Slightly better templates
* Better security through TLS (SSL) session encryption and
  certificates to authenticate masters and slaves.
* munindoc command to show plugin documentaiton.  A majority of the
  plugins are documented now - no need to read the code - in most cases ;-)
* New fab look on HTML pages, new graph colours with better contrast
* Better SNMP support: SNMP version 1, 2c and 3, all modes of authentication
  are supported (but autoconfiguration of SNMP 3 is not quite there yet).
  (only applies to "most" SNMP plugins: those that have been ported to
  use Munin::Plugin::SNMP, some remain unported)
* "includedir" in munin.conf includes all files in that directory in the
  configuration
* More than 100 new plugins since the 1.2 series
  - Among them are a set of jmx based Java plugins to monitor JVMs.
  - A new and better MySQL plugin patterned on the Cacti MySQL plugin
  - PgSQL plugins based on generic Munin::Plugin::Pgsql module
  - Asterisk plugins
  - Netapp plugin
  - And much more
* Slightly better "not Linux" support:
  - More Solaris plugins.  Solaris plugin names have been aligned with
    the other platforms.
  - Core programs should play nice on all flavours of AIX
  - Nominal OS X ("darwin") support.  (need someone to make a .img for us :-)
  - Some HP-UX plugins have been contributed
  - Good bunch of NetBSD plugins have been contributed
  - Still support for FreeBSD :-)
  - And many many others
* Ever better documentation everywhere, not least our web/wiki pages
  at munin-monitoring.org.
* More bugfixes, both in the core code and plugins, than you can shake
  a stick at
* Plugins can specify colours and printf format
* Works well with RRD 1.3
* The project site has a exiting new url: munin-monitoring.org

Other things you may want to know:
* munin-update and munin-node (and family) have been refactored and are
  much nicer to hack now.
* CGI graphing remains "in BETA" but we now have a FASTCGI script too.

Availability:
* You can find Munin 1.4.0 as source tar ball at sourceforge (
* Available in Mandriva Linux Cooker
* In Debian Experimental shortly, expected to appear in Debian Unstable 
* Expected in EPEL (Extra Packages for (Red Hat) Enterprise Linux) within
  not too long.
* Will also appear in Ubuntu later.

If you are a packager please contact us and we'll list your
support/repository/whatever on our Wiki.
